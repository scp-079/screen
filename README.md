SCP-079 website is generated by [Hakyll], hosted on GitHub Pages.

## Site

This project's static Pages are built by [GitHub Actions][actions], following 
the steps defined in [`.github/workflows/gh-pages.yml`](.github/workflows/gh-pages.yml).

## Theme

We call this Hakyll theme `Screen`. 

This is a theme intended to use on [SCP-079](https://scp-079.org) website. 
The theme is converted from a Jekyll theme [darcli](https://github.com/gildasio/darcli). 
We made some changes to make it responsive and more suitable for our site.

There is a post [demo](https://scp-079.org/posts/2019-03-29-post-test/).
